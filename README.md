# Project Setup Guide

This project is a collection of tutorials on LangGraph / LangChain / LLMs, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. Each tutorial is self-contained and can be run independently and is for practice and learning purposes only.

Many thanks to many other developers out there who have contributed and teach others how to use LangGraph / LangChain / LLMs. These tutorials are not possible without their work. I do not take any credit for these tutorials. My goal is to provide a simple easy way to run the tutorials, so that others can learn and implement these technologies.
